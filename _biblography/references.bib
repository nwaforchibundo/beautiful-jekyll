The two observatory sites will be separated by 1 km distance to help eliminate false positives and register a definitive signal. We discuss the overall mechanical design of the telescope modules which includes a Fresnel lens housing, a shutter, three baffles, an 32x32 array of Hamamatsu Multi-Photon Pixel Counting (MPPC) detectors that reside on a linear stage for focusing. Each telescope module will be housed in a triangle of a 3rd tessellation frequency geodesic dome that has the ability to have directional adjustment to correct for manufacturing tolerances and astrometric alignment to the second observatory site. Each observatory will have an enclosure to protect the experiment, and an observatory room for operations and electronics. We will review the overall design of the geodesic domes and mechanical telescope attachments, as well as the overall cabling and observatory infrastructure layout.},

  abstract = {As it stands today, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is highly dependent on our ability to detect interesting candidate signals, or technosignatures, in radio telescope observations and distinguish these from human radio frequency interference (RFI). Current signal search pipelines look for signals in spectrograms of intensity as a function of time and frequency (which can be thought of as images), but tend to do poorly in identifying multiple signals in a single data frame. This is especially apparent when there are dim signals in the same frame as bright, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) signals. In this work, we approach this problem using convolutional neural networks (CNN) as a computationally efficient method for localizing signals in synthetic observations resembling data collected by Breakthrough Listen using the Green Bank Telescope. We generate two synthetic data sets, the first with exactly one signal at various S/N levels and the second with exactly two signals, one of which represents RFI. We find that a residual CNN with strided convolutions and using multiple image normalizations as input outperforms a more basic CNN with max pooling trained on inputs with only one normalization. Training each model on a smaller subset of the training data at higher S/N levels results in a significant increase in model performance, reducing root mean square errors by at least a factor of 3 at an S/N of 25 dB. Although each model produces outliers with significant error, these results demonstrate that using CNNs to analyze signal location is promising, especially in image frames that are crowded with multiple signals.},

  abstract = {The goal of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is the detection of non-human technosignatures, such as technology-produced emission in radio observations. While many have speculated about the character of such technosignatures, radio SETI fundamentally involves searching for signals that not only have never been detected, but also have a vast range of potential morphologies. Given that we have not yet detected a radio SETI signal, we must make assumptions about their form to develop search algorithms. The lack of positive detections also makes it difficult to test these algorithms' inherent efficacy. To address these challenges, we present Setigen, a Python-based, open-source library for heuristic-based signal synthesis and injection for both spectrograms (dynamic spectra) and raw voltage data. Setigen facilitates the production of synthetic radio observations, interfaces with standard data products used extensively by the Breakthrough Listen project (BL), and focuses on providing a physically-motivated synthesis framework compatible with real observational data and associated search methods. We discuss the core routines of Setigen and present existing and future use cases in the development and evaluation of SETI search algorithms.},

Conversely, discoveries about the terrestrial biosphere\textemdash from extremophilic microbes to the evolution of intelligence\textemdash inform our thinking about prospects for life elsewhere. Astrobiology includes the search for extraterrestrial life via in situ exploration, spectroscopy of solar and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This review situates astrobiology within philosophical issues of the definition of life and the biological compatibility of the universe. It reviews the habitability of the Galaxy in general and of planets and moons in particular, and summarizes current controversies in origins-of-life research and in evidence for the earliest life on Earth. It critiques certain ``rare Earth'' and ``anthropic'' arguments, and considers four approaches to deciding whether intelligent life exists elsewhere in the Galaxy. It concludes that astrobiology must also speak to the future of human civilization.},
