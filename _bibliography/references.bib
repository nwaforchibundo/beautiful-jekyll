  abstract = {New ambitious initiatives searching for technosignatures from exo-civilizations are currently being pursued and others are planned in the future, allowing exploration of the parameter search space on an unprecedented scale. Despite this intense activity and the decades-old history of related searches, there have been only limited efforts in analyzing systematically the prospects of either the detection or the non-detection of technosignatures. This chapter will review the recent progress made in developing full physical-statistical descriptions of electromagnetic technosignatures that could possibly populate the Milky Way.},
