Glass has proved to be one of the most inevitable materials for the fast-emerging field of micromachining technology. 
It has a desirable optical and good isolation property~\cite{tay, Takahashi2013}, which in addition to their biocompatibility, chemical stability, hydrophilicity, and optical transparency, 
makes them suited for various applications ranging from Optical/Bio-MEMS, micro-actuators, micro-sensors, and the Lab-on-chip device. 
The development of microfabrication in glass techniques over the years enabled different microcomponents and applications ranging from microfluidic (microchannels)~\cite{TANG2021129859, Cheng03, Kikutani02, Hnatovsky06}, 
optical (optical alignment, waveguide, and positioners)~\cite{Rosa_2015, Karnaushkin21, 122313982, Mittholiya16}, mechanical parts (nozzles, gears)~\cite{NIZA20101797, Montanero10, EKLUND2008175, WANG2010684}, 
micro-actuators~\cite{14750236,12364504, WANG2009120,260256, Sakurai15,11643056, WANG2009120,12800777} and sensors~\cite{LIN1997200, 122183334, ZUSMAN1990107, ROGERS1995113, 201000283, s141019402, VLASOV19941059, mi14010226, bios12111038, s22031126}.

Figure~\ref{glass_devices} presents some of the 3D miniaturized and monolithic devices in the literature that are fabricated with glass using different approaches. Figure~\ref{glass_devices}A show the 
possibility of 3D volumetric additive manufacturing of silica glass with microscale computed axial lithography for microstructures with minimum feature sizes of 50$\mu$m. 
It is also possible to use a maskless approach to fabricate in glass by laser micro-welding which usually involves non-adhesive bonding of two pre-printed surfaces (see~\ref{glass_devices} B) The case of 500 nm diameter 
silica micro/nanofibre for optical sensors, which is fabricated by taper-drawing glass fiber at high temperature is presented in~\ref{glass_devices}C. It is also possible to fabricate arbitrary 3D suspended hollow microstructures in 
transparent fused silica glass using stereolithography as shown in~\ref{glass_devices}D. Using selective laser-induced etching, this presents the most predominant approach which is used from Figure~\ref{glass_devices}E to Figure~\ref{glass_devices}N, 
for designing different complex 3D monolithic micro-structures in a  glass.

While conventional glass at the macro scale is rigid and brittle, conversely, at the micro-scale level, thin glass is flexible with high tensile strength~\cite{Silveira2016, Glaesemann2}. 
These inherent properties of glass on a micro-scale are beneficial in the design of miniaturized 3D structures. Therefore, one can take advantage of glass at the micro-scale to design and fabricate miniaturized flexible microstructure~\cite{s18030903}. 
Consequently, this solidifies the possibility of designing and fabricating a continuum robot using thin glass.  Moreover, for CTRs, higher dexterity in a tightly confined region requires a small radius of curvature~\cite{CHIKHAOUI2016234}. 
For this reason, we ask the question of whether tubes made of glass, with a sub-millimeter diameter can permit a small radius of curvature without breaking. 
The proposed glass for the robot design is fused silica. Its surface stress can significantly be reduced by using a protective polymer coating, which is common in optics fiber to increase its mechanical rigidity.
In addition, its mechanical strength can be further improved by minimizing the flaws in glass and enabling a low surface area because a small size limits the risk of the presence of flaws~\cite{ms26080196000355, Wondraczek22, Bellouard11}. 
All these factors guarantee the ability of capillary glass to withstand high bending stress (see Figure~\ref{glass_bend_test}). 
It also allows the capillary glass to have flexibility similar to the spring steel. Fused silica has a non-linear elastic property and the applied strain determines the elastic modulus~\cite{1970JAP4208B,10181373}, 
with the maximum bend radius of curvature, deduced by considering tensile strength in Equation~\ref{eq_41}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq_41}
\sigma = E_{o}\frac{r_c}{r}\left[ 1+\alpha\frac{r_c}{r}+\beta\left( \frac{r_c}{r} \right)^{2} \right]
\end{equation}
\noindent
$\sigma$ is the surface stress, $E_o$ is Young's modulus at zero strain (70GPa), $r_c$ is the capillary radius, and $r$ is the bending radius of curvature. 
$\alpha=2.30$ and $\beta=8.48$ are the second-order and third-order nonlinear material coefficients, respectively.\\ 

For the proposed miniaturized CTR, when considering the glass tube diameters used, the relationship between their bending stress and the obtainable radius of curvature, as derived using Equation~\ref{eq_41} is presented in Figure~\ref{state_of_art15}. 
% Although theoretically, the ultimate tensile strength of fused silica can reach 4.83GPa (green dash line), we considered nominal bending stress of 0.69GPa (black dash line); this consideration is in line with the Polymicro  
poof test (\href{https://www.molex.com/mx_upload/superfamily/polymicro/theBOOK.pdf}{Polymicro Technologies}).
The figure explains why it was possible to obtain a small bend radius of curvature in glass down to 5 mm with tube diameter below 440$\mu$m (full detail in Chapter~\ref{chap2}), 
which is very flexible to sustain bending stress below nominal value without fracture. This is highlighted and considered as our target area in Figure~\ref{state_of_art15}. 
Considering its ultimate tensile strength, the figure indicates that it can withstand more stress in cases of path contact during deployment and manipulation. 
% For both glass and Nitinol, the precurvature limits, or the obtainable minimum radius of curvature, depend on the available tube diameter; a smaller tube diameter guarantees a smaller radius of curvature without plastic deformation.
Figure~\ref{state_of_art15} also demonstrated that it is theoretically possible for a 1 mm glass tube to sustain bending stress over a 10 mm radius of curvature like that of Nitinol, which has a minimum radius of 
curvature of 15 mm in literature~\cite{sears2006}. The various approach explored to obtain a pre-curved tube using thin glass for the proposed miniaturized concentric tube robot (CTR) in Chapter~\ref{chap4} is 
discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{chap3}. Whereas for the parallel continuum robot (PCR), a standard optical fiber was used directly for the robot modeling, design, and experimental prototype, which is detailed in Chapter~\ref{chap5}. 
Overall, we demonstrated the possibility to actualize the first of its type, a miniaturized continuum robot using glass material. This landmark achievement and scientific breakthrough has huge prospects in the robotics and material domain as 
regards microsurgery or micromanipulations.
