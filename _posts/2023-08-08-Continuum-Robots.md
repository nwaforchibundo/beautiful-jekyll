The evolution in medical intervention from traditional open surgery to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has resulted in improved surgical outcomes such as less patient trauma, less blood loss, and shorter recovery time. These improvements are due to miniature incisions compared to the large openings in the patient's body. However, this technique has significant challenges such as difficulty in accessing surgical targets through complex 3D paths and the ability to control the rigid instruments due to limited maneuverability, dexterity, and degrees of freedom~\cite{6392862}. The goal of robotic-assisted surgery was to improve surgical procedures while maintaining the advantages of open surgery in MIS~\cite{Satava2003}. These include facilitating easy access to complex or hard-to-reach surgical targets with greater dexterity and DoFs, enhanced visualization of the anatomy; improved tool deployment precision/accuracy; reduced surgeon hand tremors and fatigue during tool manipulation or teleoperation~\cite{Satava2011}. All these have paved the way for developing different MIS intervention tools and instruments categorized into three by Dupont et al.~\cite{5371822} as presented in Figure~\ref{class_of_MIS}.

With lots of different progress today, there are still huge areas in medical intervention needing technological improvements. The majority of these demands have been in the area of developing smart devices with better properties and characteristics for targeted applications. These include achieving high overall robot miniaturization for possible handheld capability and single-port deployability. Among other features are high dexterity, high precision, high maneuverability, and safer robot-to-human interaction. To that effect, all these have resulted in the paradigm shift in medical robotics research, from the traditional rigid robot to the continuum (continuously deformable) and soft robots. This emerging field of research has drawn enormous focus today due to its overwhelming potential and benefits.
