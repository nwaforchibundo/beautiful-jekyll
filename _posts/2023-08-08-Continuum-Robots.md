The evolution in medical intervention from traditional open surgery to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has resulted in improved surgical outcomes such as less patient trauma, less blood loss, and shorter recovery time. These improvements are due to miniature incisions compared to the large openings in the patient's body. However, this technique has significant challenges such as difficulty in accessing surgical targets through complex 3D paths and the ability to control the rigid instruments due to limited maneuverability, dexterity, and degrees of freedom~\cite{6392862}. The goal of robotic-assisted surgery was to improve surgical procedures while maintaining the advantages of open surgery in MIS~\cite{Satava2003}. These include facilitating easy access to complex or hard-to-reach surgical targets with greater dexterity and DoFs, enhanced visualization of the anatomy; improved tool deployment precision/accuracy; reduced surgeon hand tremors and fatigue during tool manipulation or teleoperation~\cite{Satava2011}. All these have paved the way for developing different MIS intervention tools and instruments categorized into three by Dupont et al.~\cite{5371822} as presented in Figure~\ref{class_of_MIS}. 

With lots of different progress today, there are still huge areas in medical intervention needing technological improvements. The majority of these demands have been in the area of developing smart devices with better properties and characteristics for targeted applications. These include achieving high overall robot miniaturization for possible handheld capability and single-port deployability. Among other features are high dexterity, high precision, high maneuverability, and safer robot-to-human interaction. To that effect, all these have resulted in the paradigm shift in medical robotics research, from the traditional rigid robot to the continuum (continuously deformable) and soft robots. This emerging field of research has drawn enormous focus today due to its overwhelming potential and benefits.

The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. 
All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. 
Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. 
Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. 
Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. 
They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. 
They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. 
What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. 
Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. 
If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
